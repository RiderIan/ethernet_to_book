# FPGA 1G Ethernet to Book Engine for ITCH Market Data

## Overview
A low-latency FPGA implementation of 1G networking stack for processing UDP packets containing ITCH market data and maintaining an on fabric order book. Add, delete, and order executed messages are supported. The order map is fully functional and the buy side of the book is complete. Sell side, deeper verification, and hardware testing is in progress. Zero IP was used in this project (except for a Xilinx IP AFIFO which was used only to benchmark a custom CDC solution). **This project is in progress and is not a finished/polished work**

## Features
- **Custom MAC**
- **Low-Latency CDC**
- **Ethernet, IpV4, and UDP header parser**
- **ITCH Market Data Parser**
- **Order Map**
- **Variable Depth Order Map**  (depth of 2k target for timing)
- **Variable Depth Order Book** (depth of 5 targeted for timing)
- **Tick to Book Latency of 845ns for Add Order Messages**

## Architecture
### Data Path
1. **Custom MAC**
    - Performs essentially zero parsing of the incoming ethernet packet. It includes DDR decoding and then simply passes the received byte upstream.
    - Interfaces with 1G PHY via RMGII. Clock to data skew is acheived internally via MMCM generated clock.
2. **Low-Latency CDC**
    - Bytes are streamed from the 125MHz rx domain to the 250MHz processing domain.
    - While all processing could be done on the rx clk domain it is safer to process on a clock generated on device. The rx clk is provided off board making it susceptible to glitches. Also it is not guarenteed to be running at all times.
    - A circular AFIFO CDC method was implemented with a minimal synchronization pipeline.
    - Latency across the CDC is ~14ns compared to ~42ns of the Xilinx xpm_fifo_async IP which can be optionally generated in the design as a benchmark.
3. **Ethernet Header Parser**
    - Parses ethernet frame headers (eth, ip, udp, moldUdp64) as they stream in. If a valid frame has been received on the last byte, the proceeding ITCH data is passed through with zero cycles of latency added.
    - Checks MAC dest address, ip version, ip dest address, ip checksum, protocol, udp destination, and moldUdp64 sequence.
4. **ITCH Parser**
    - Extracts add, delete, and order executed message types. Also on-the-fly parsing where forwarded data is driven to the outputs when it is received.
    - Separate valid signals for each message type assert when all important fields have been received.
    - Data field outputs are shared (i.e reference number).
    - Zero additional cycles added to forwarded data.
4.  **Order Map**
    - The order map is of variable depth with 2K depth being targeted for timing closure.
    - A hash table is implemented where the received ITCH reference number is passed through a hash function to index into BRAM. The RAM is initialized to zeros which is how the insertion detects if an address has been written to. Upon order deletion, the location will be zeroed out freeing it for future use.
    - One 64bit X 2K BRAM is used for reference number storage while a second 65 bit X 2K BRAM is used for price, quantity, and side data of correlating reference number.
5. **Order Book** (buy side done, sell side in progress)
    - Add order message type implemented with tick to top of book update in 845ns.
    - Single instrument supported with variable depth.
    - All price levels are updated in 3 clock upon receiving a new order no matter the book depth. Add orders make it to the book level faster as delete/execute messages must be looked up in BRAM first, but both types only require 3 clocks once they are received.
    - Delete and Executed messages will have higher latency due to the need for a lookup in the map.
    - Node or "linked list" based design allows for scalable book depth. Levels of logic are O(1) as book depth increases. Even though level of logic are not a concern, routing congestion and fanout will ultimatelty limit book depth.

## Implementation Details
- Target Artix 7 FPGA. Diligent Nexy video board will be used for hardware verification (in progress).
- System Verilog for synthesizable code and test benches.
